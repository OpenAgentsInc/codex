# User Management in Boardwalk Cash

## User State

The user state in Boardwalk Cash includes:
- Public key (pubkey)
- Private key (privkey)
- Username
- Contacts (array of PublicContact)
- Status ('idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed')
- Error information

## User Initialization

The `initializeUser` function is implemented as a Redux Toolkit async thunk. Here's how it works:

1. Check localStorage for existing user keys (public and private).
2. If keys don't exist:
   - Generate new keys using Nostr tools
   - Store the new keys in localStorage
   - Check for existing keysets in localStorage
   - Create a new user with a placeholder username
   - Store user data in localStorage
3. If keys exist:
   - Fetch user data from the server
   - If no username is found, create a placeholder and update on the server

## Key Components

1. **UserSlice**: Redux slice for managing user state
   - Handles user initialization, adding contacts, and updating username
   - Manages loading states and error handling

2. **LocalStorage**: Used for storing:
   - Private key
   - Public key
   - Keysets (mint information)

3. **API Interactions**:
   - `createUser`: Creates a new user on the server
   - `fetchUser`: Retrieves user data from the server
   - `updateUser`: Updates user information on the server

## User Actions

1. **Add Contact**: `addContactAction`
   - Adds a new contact to the user's contact list

2. **Update Username**: `updateUsernameAction`
   - Updates the user's username

## Known Issues and Improvement Areas

1. **App-level Initialization**: 
   - Current implementation initializes user at the page level
   - Need to move initialization to the app level for consistency (Issue #79)

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Current error handling is basic, returning a generic error message
   - Opportunity to implement more detailed error handling and user feedback

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Private keys are stored in localStorage, which may pose security risks
   - Consider implementing more secure key storage methods

4. **Username Generation**:
   - Currently uses a simple placeholder username based on public key
   - Could be improved with a more user-friendly username generation or prompt for user input

5. **Multiple Keysets**:
   - Current implementation throws an error if multiple keysets are found
   - Could be improved to handle multiple keysets more gracefully

6. **State Persistence**:
   - Heavy reliance on localStorage for key application data
   - Consider implementing more robust state persistence mechanisms

7. **Asynchronous Operations**:
   - User initialization involves multiple asynchronous operations
   - Ensure proper error handling and state management for all async operations

## Suggested Improvements

1. Implement a custom hook (e.g., `useUser`) for easier access to user data and actions across components.
2. Move user initialization to the app level for consistent user state across pages.
3. Enhance error handling with more specific error types and helpful error messages.
4. Implement a more secure method for storing sensitive information like private keys.
5. Develop a more robust username generation system or implement a user onboarding flow for username selection.
6. Refactor to handle multiple keysets if that's a desired feature.
7. Consider using a more secure and centralized storage solution for user data and proofs.
