# User Management in Boardwalk Cash

Based on the analysis of the UserSlice.ts file, here's what we know about user management in Boardwalk Cash:

## User State

The user state includes:
- Public key (pubkey)
- Private key (privkey)
- Username
- Contacts
- Status ('idle' | 'loading' | 'succeeded' | 'failed')
- Error information

## User Initialization

1. The `initializeUser` function is implemented as a Redux Toolkit async thunk.
2. It checks localStorage for existing user keys (public and private).
3. If keys don't exist:
   - New keys are generated
   - A new user is created with a placeholder username
   - User data is stored in localStorage
4. If keys exist:
   - User data is fetched from the server
   - If no username is found, a placeholder is created and updated on the server

## Known Issues

1. User initialization is likely called at the page level, which may lead to inconsistent user states across different pages.
2. Error handling for user not found or initialization failure could be improved.
3. The implementation mixes concerns by handling both local storage and API calls within the same function.

## Suggested Improvements

1. Move user initialization to the app level for consistency across all pages.
2. Implement a more robust error handling mechanism.
3. Create a custom hook (e.g., `useUser`) for simplified access to user data across components.
4. Separate concerns by moving localStorage operations and API calls to separate utility functions.
5. Enhance error handling with more specific error types and messages.
