# Boardwalk Cash Architecture

Based on the available information, here's an overview of the Boardwalk Cash architecture:

## Technology Stack

- Frontend: Likely uses a modern JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Vue, or Angular)
- State Management: Redux (confirmed by the use of Redux Toolkit)
- API: RESTful API for user management and possibly other features

## Key Components

1. **Redux Store**: Manages the application's state, including user information.

2. **UserSlice**: Handles user-related state and actions, including user initialization.

3. **Local Storage**: Used for storing user keys (public and private) locally.

4. **API Integration**: Communicates with a backend server for user data and possibly other functionalities.

## Data Flow

1. User initialization:
   - Check local storage for existing keys
   - If keys exist, fetch user data from the server
   - If keys don't exist, generate new keys and create a new user

2. User actions:
   - Likely dispatched through Redux actions
   - May include operations like adding contacts or updating username

3. State updates:
   - Handled by Redux reducers
   - Reflect changes in user data, contacts, or application status

## Suggested Improvements

1. Implement a custom hook (e.g., `useUser`) for easier access to user data and actions across components.
2. Move user initialization to the app level for consistent user state across pages.
3. Separate concerns in the user initialization process (e.g., local storage operations, API calls).
4. Enhance error handling with more specific error types and messages.
