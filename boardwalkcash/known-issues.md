# Known Issues in Boardwalk Cash

Based on the analysis of the available information, here are some known issues and areas for improvement in the Boardwalk Cash project:

1. **User Initialization at Page Level**
   - Issue: User initialization is likely called at the page level.
   - Impact: This can lead to inconsistent user states across different pages.
   - Suggestion: Move user initialization to the app level to ensure consistency across all pages.

2. **Error Handling**
   - Issue: The current error handling for user not found or initialization failure could be improved.
   - Impact: Users may not receive clear feedback when errors occur.
   - Suggestion: Implement a more robust error handling mechanism with specific error types and helpful error messages.

3. **Mixed Concerns in User Initialization**
   - Issue: The current implementation mixes concerns by handling both local storage and API calls within the same function.
   - Impact: This can make the code harder to maintain and test.
   - Suggestion: Separate concerns by moving localStorage operations and API calls to separate utility functions.

4. **Lack of Centralized User Management**
   - Issue: There's no clear centralized way to handle user initialization across the application.
   - Impact: This can lead to redundant code and potential inconsistencies in user state management.
   - Suggestion: Implement a custom hook (e.g., `useUser`) that wraps the Redux logic and provides an easy-to-use interface for components to access user data and status.

5. **Potential Security Concerns**
   - Issue: Storing private keys in localStorage could pose security risks if not properly handled.
   - Impact: User's private keys could potentially be compromised.
   - Suggestion: Review the security measures for storing sensitive information and consider more secure alternatives if necessary.

6. **Placeholder Usernames**
   - Issue: The system creates placeholder usernames when a username is not found.
   - Impact: Users might end up with auto-generated usernames they don't prefer.
   - Suggestion: Implement a user onboarding flow that encourages users to set their preferred username.

Note: These issues are identified based on the limited information available in the knowledge base. The actual project may have addressed some or all of these issues, or may have different concerns altogether.
